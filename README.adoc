== 🎯 Mission

Make the web accessible to the *1+ billion people* worldwide with disabilities by following the proven HTTPS playbook: combine free tools, public accountability, and economic incentives to drive universal adoption.

=== The Problem

- *96% of top websites* have accessibility errors (WebAIM 2024)
- Legal mandates (ADA, WCAG) exist but adoption remains low
- No economic incentive for accessibility improvements
- Developers lack easy-to-use, free tools

=== Our Solution

Follow the HTTPS success model:

| HTTPS (2014-2019) | Accessibility Everywhere (2024+) |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Browser warnings | Browser extension showing scores |
| Let's Encrypt (free certs) | Free API + tools + infrastructure |
| Public pressure | Accessibility leaderboard |
| Google ranking boost | *Goal: Search ranking factor* |

*Result for HTTPS*: 45% → 95% adoption in 5 years

*Goal for Accessibility*: Same transformative impact

=== 5. CLI Tool
Command-line accessibility scanning

```bash
npm install -g @accessibility-everywhere/cli

=== 6. npm Package
Programmatic accessibility scanning for developers

```javascript
const { createScanner } = require('@accessibility-everywhere/scanner');

const scanner = createScanner();

  url: 'https://example.com',
  wcagLevel: 'AA'
});

console.log(`Score: ${result.score}/100`);
```

== 📊 Proposed Web Standards

=== Accessibility-Policy Header
```http
Accessibility-Policy: wcag-level=AA; public-score=true; report-uri=/api/a11y

{
  "version": "1.0",
  "wcag": { "level": "AA", "version": "2.1" },
  "score": { "value": 94, "public": true },
  "contact": { "email": "accessibility@example.com" }
}
```

=== DNS TXT Record
```
_accessibility.example.com TXT "v=ACCESSIBILITY1; wcag=AA; score=94"

== 📈 Impact

=== Current Web Accessibility
- 96% of top sites have errors (WebAIM 2024)
- 1+ billion people affected globally
- $13 trillion in disability community spending
- Growing legal liability (ADA lawsuits)

=== Our Goal
- 50% reduction in errors (top 1M sites) by Year 3
- 100,000+ developers using tools daily
- Major search engines commit to ranking factor
- Universal standard for accessibility verification

---

== 🌟 Why This Will Work

=== Proven Model
HTTPS adoption (2014-2019):
- Started: 45% adoption
- Google ranking factor announced
- Free infrastructure (Let's Encrypt)
- Public pressure (browser warnings)
- Result: 95% adoption in 5 years

=== Our Advantages
1. *Legal mandate*: ADA, WCAG already legally required
2. *Moral imperative*: Stronger ethical case than HTTPS
3. *Market size*: 1+ billion disabled users
4. *Existing standards*: WCAG 2.1/2.2 well-defined
5. *Free tools*: Remove all cost barriers
6. *Community*: Strong accessibility advocacy
